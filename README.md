## Overview

This is my personal skeleton project to quickstart Java app development in Maven.

- Particularly optimized for coding review examination (coding test)
  - You can produce ready-to-go executable jar via `mvn package` and submit it!
  - You can use the state-of-the-art unit testing framework JUnit5!
